 Smart Oxy Finger Tip Pulse Black Oximeter

Description
The BPL Pulse Oximeter is used to measure your pulse rate and oxygen levels in the blood, and it comes in a small, easy-to-use form. Pulse oximeters are used in many medical cases mostly relating to lungs and breathing issues, for example during or after surgery, to check how the lung treatments are progressing, to monitor the body's ability to handle physical activity, to determine whether a person requires a ventilator if their lungs aren’t providing enough oxygen and many other similar situations. The BPL Oximeter helps people regularly check and monitor their blood oxygen levels from home, in case they are not receiving enough oxygen through regular breathing. It is often recommended to patients who have had heart attacks, heart failures or currently have anaemia, COPD, Lung cancer, Asthma or Pneumonia.

Benefits
It is a non-invasive process that uses light to measure the pulse rate and oxygen level in your blood.
BPL Pulse Oximeter is highly accurate, tracking the oxygen concentration to an accuracy of +/- 2%, and +/- 2bpm for pulse measurement.
The colour OLED display shows the SpO2 (blood concentration), SpO2 waveform, pulse rate as well as pulse index (strength of the signal from which readings are measured).
It also has an alarm option that users can set themselves, which will then alert you if your readings are too low.
It is battery operated, which makes this small BPL oximeter easily portable.
