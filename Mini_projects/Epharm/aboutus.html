          <h4>
          An online pharmacy "Epharm" helped to build e-commerce in the
          healthcare industry (e-pharmacy). The Pharmacy "E-pharm," which offers
          medications and medical supplies, is one of the pharmacies that is now
          under development. There are daily customers purchasing and selling
          transactions over there. In order to better serve the clients the
          pharmacy "Epharm" established an online pharmacy. E-pharm has been
          putting forth pharmacy administrations to our clients for more than
          100 years. We know the pharmacy and wellbeing and magnificence
          industry back to front, continually guaranteeing we offer the most
          breakthrough items and medications. We bring our customers the best
          quality administration and give the nearby network and neighboring
          wards a brilliant, understanding-centered administration. The system's
          web application can influence how things are bought and sold in
          specific pharmacies.Additionally, employing a web-based or online
          sales system to establish online pharmacies makes it impossible to
          directly monitor the business operations and the availability of
          medications in pharmacies. The "E-pharm" pharmacy is anticipated to
          boost sales, provide better customer service, make transaction
          reporting easier, and compete with existing pharmacies. In light of
          the aforementioned debate, the aim of this study is to create and
          implement a user-friendly drug service information system in order to
          support job efficiency at the "E-pharm".</h4>
